# Family-Travel-Tracker
This project is a Node.js/Express backend for a Family Travel Tracker web app. It uses PostgreSQL to store users and their visited countries. Each user can log in, add new countries they've visited, and see their travel history. The backend handles user management, country lookups, and tracks which countries each user has visited using relational tables. All data operations—such as adding users, searching for countries, and recording visits—are performed with secure, parameterized SQL queries via the pg library. The backend ensures efficient data retrieval and updates, making it easy to manage multiple users and their travel records.
